        <h2>What are CSS Selectors?</h2>
        <p>CSS selectors are interesting to learn because in order to style a bunch of elements inside the HTML document
            we
            have to be ready to <span class="adjectives">select</span> and <span class="adjectives">separate</span> them
            from the rest of the elements which we do
            not want to style.</p>
        <p>There is a whole list of CSS selectors designed to make <span class="adjectives">interesting</span> and <span
                class="adjectives">exctiting</span>
            things, but I will test tome right now, below.</p>

        <h2>How many types of selectors are there?</h2>
        <p>Well, quite a lot, but let's start slow and show everything first.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <div class="element">
                    <h3>Universal and element selector</h3>
                    <p>This type of selector is interesting because it selects every possible element that is within the
                        HTML code.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="element">
                    <h3>The ID selector</h3>
                    <p>This type of selector is also intresting because it selects something with the given ID.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="element">
                    <h3>The Class Selector</h3>
                    <p>This type of selector makes a styling based on the class selection of those elements</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="element">
                    <h3>Descendant Selector</h3>
                    <p>This type of selector selects only the elements that are nested inside another element.</p>

                    <h3>Combinator Selector</h3>
                    <p>This type of selector selects only the elements that are <span class="adjectives">preceded</span>
                        by another entity.

                            Children</span> by another

                    <p>This type of selector makes a selection with the elements that have a
                        <span>specific</span> attribute.

        <h2>The different types of CSS elements</h2>
        <p>There are around 2 different types of different elements</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#pselm">Pseudo Elements</a></li>
            <li><a href="#psclass">Pseudo Classes</a></li>

                    <h2>Pseudo Classes</h2>
                    <p>These type of classes have a particular keyword that represent a particular state of that
                        selected element, such as: checkboxes, hovered over, first child etc.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Pseudo elements</h2>
                    <p>These type of elements have a particular keyword that represents a particular part of that
                        selected element such as: first letter of paragraphs, first line, before and after a paragraph
                        etc</p>

        <h2 id="ccdmodel">The CSS Cascade Model</h2>
        <p>Because CSS is an acronym from Cascade Style Sheets, the order in which those elements are styled actually
            matters a whole lot, whether we have one stylesheet or not</p>

    <section class="heading">
        <h2>CSS Specificity</h2>
        <p>There is a general rule that every browser follows, which is focused more around how specific a selection is.
            The more specific, the more important.</p>
        <p>The general formula follows is as follows :</p>
        <h3 id="specformula">ID > CLASS > ELEMENT</h3>
        <p>This sorta of <span class="adjectives">war</span> applies only when there is a conflict between two
            selectors. If those two are equal in specificity, because of the <a href="#ccdmodel">CSS Cascade Model</a>,
            the one which is a the bottom wins.</p>
