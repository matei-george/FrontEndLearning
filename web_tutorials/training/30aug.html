    <h1>This is my website</h1>
    <p>It's very easy to learn html just from hearing, but it's a bit harder to learn if you don't practice often.
    One of the important thing to learn and understand when practicing is that practice makes perfect.
    Below is a <strong>list</strong> of all my knowledge of HTML so far</p>
    <!--Part 2::Lists-->
    <h2>Here you can have the choice to click to go to 2 lists that are essential in HTML</h2>
    <p>You can click to go to the <a href="#ordered">ordered</a> list if you want.</p>
    <p>You can click to go to the <a href="#unordered">unordered</a> list if you want, your choice.</p>
    <div id="ordered">
        <ol> Things that I want to learn
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JS</li>
            <li>React</li>

    <div id="unordered">
        <ul> Thing that I already know
            <li>C</li>
            <li>C++</li>

    <p>
        Probably one of the most important and interesting things about HTML and the DOM is the fact that we as programmers
        can use it to link to other files using text, images and other things that we have on the website. We can also use 
        HTML to just already compose mails with subjects, cc or bcc and destination address. For example:
    </p>
    <!--Part3::Linkage and mails-->
    <p>We can use <strong><a href="../BASICS/first-tutorial/index.html">simple text</a></strong> to create links bewtween different web pages.
    Or, we can use images<a href="../BASICS/first-tutorial/index.html">
        <img src="../BASICS/first-tutorial/images/image.jpg" title="Car image i found on Google" alt="VW car image">
    </a>
    to link to other web pages as well.
